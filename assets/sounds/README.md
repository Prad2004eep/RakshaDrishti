# Ringtone File

To enable the fake call ringtone feature, add a ringtone file named `ringtone.mp3` to this directory.

## Requirements:
- File name: `ringtone.mp3`
- Format: MP3
- Recommended duration: 10-30 seconds
- Recommended size: < 1MB

## Where to get ringtones:
- Use any royalty-free ringtone
- Record your own
- Use default phone ringtones

## Note:
The app will work without this file, but the fake call will be silent (no ringtone will play).
